#PLAIN LANGUAGE
* We get **exclusive**first worldwide rights in all print formats, including anthology rights *and the ability to grant those rights*, for one year post-publication. We get **non-exclusive**rights after that for the term of copyright. That's so we can keep selling the anthologies, even if you sell your story elsewhere again after one year. I ask for the ability to grant the rights so that if someone larger wants to print the anthology, I can sell those rights to them.    
* If you put the story in your own collection, we get credit.  
* We won't muck up your story unless you specifically okay it in writing.  
* You keep all rights we haven't specifically asked for (for example, audio rights, Spanish-language rights).  
* Flash fiction gets paid a flat fee. Short story authors split the royalties after editors and publishers and the like take their cut. Some of the editors & artists may prefer a flat fee as well, which means a greater percentage for authors but more copies have to be sold before you start seeing royalties. Your percentage of royalties will be based off the percentage of words you contribute to the book.   
* We'll publish within 12 months of acceptance. If you point out that we haven't, we'll get three more months, or else the rights all go back to you. We determine how we will publish the work, though.  
* It's your story. You're responsible.  
* We'll pay you royalties at least quarterly. You can ask how many copies have been sold once a year, but we may tell you more often than that.  
* We'll keep paying royalties as long as the work is in print. If we decide to take it out of print, we have to tell you. If - after you ask - we don't put it back in print within nine months, all rights revert to you.  
* If we go bankrupt or something else like that, all rights revert to you. No orphaned stories here.
