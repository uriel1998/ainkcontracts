#GRANT OF RIGHTS

The Artist grants nonexclusive worldwide print and digital rights to the Artwork for the purposes of digital and print covers for the Work and for promotion of the Work (e.g. flyers, bookmarks, favicons). "Promotional purposes" should not be able to serve as a substitute for a print of the Artwork and should clearly be in service to promoting the Work.

All rights to the Work not expressly granted to the Publisher in this Agreement are reserved by The Artist. In exercising such rights, The Artist shall reserve for the Publisher's benefit the rights granted to the Publisher in this Agreement.   

The Artist will be credited on the table of contents page and at the beginning of the Work as **author’s byline**

#PAYMENTS; ROYALTIES

In compensation for this grant of rights, the Publisher hereby agrees to pay the Artist a one-time licensing fee of US$**NUMBER**. This fee shall be paid at **TIME**.  Should the work be determined unsatisfactory for any reason, half of the licensing fee will be paid as a kill fee.

#PUBLISH-BY OR REVERT

The Publisher agrees to exercise this Agreement within 6 months of its acceptance. If the Publisher fails to do so, this Agreement shall terminate, and all rights granted herein shall revert to the Artist.   
Artists are freelance contractors and not employees of *Alliteration Ink* or its principals.
