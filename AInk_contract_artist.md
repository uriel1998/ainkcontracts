All rights to the Work not expressly granted to the Publisher in this Agreement are reserved by The Artist. In exercising such rights, The Artist shall reserve for the Publisher's benefit the rights granted to the Publisher in this Agreement.

#PUBLISH-BY OR REVERT

The Publisher agrees to exercise this Agreement within 6 months of its acceptance. If the Publisher fails to do so, this Agreement shall terminate, and all rights granted herein shall revert to the Artist.
